# Realistic Water Shader for Godot 4

This is a work in progress port of [Godot Realistic Water](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-realistic-water) to Godot 4.0.

The original shader was created by UnionBytes, Achim Menzel (alias AiYori). That project, and this port, are available under the MIT license.
