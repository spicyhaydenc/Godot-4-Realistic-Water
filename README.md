# Realistic Water Shader for Godot 4

This is a work in progress port of [Godot Realistic Water](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-realistic-water) to Godot 4.0. A writeup of the porting process is available [here](https://spicychicken.club/porting-the-realistic-water-shader-to-godot-4/), and a brief clip of the shader running under all three renderers in Godot 4 is available [here](https://youtu.be/1_YxFAKPVL0).

The original shader was created by UnionBytes, Achim Menzel (alias AiYori). That project, and this port, are available under the MIT license.
